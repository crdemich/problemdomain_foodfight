### Modeling a problem domain

In a prospective food fight game, presuming two players allowed for by the rules, you would have combatant class, weapon classes, and a luck class. The combatant classes would have properties for mobility/footing, visibility and cleanliness, and the food would have corresponding properties for how much damage they did to the combatant's features. Our weapons would be banana cream pie, yoghurt, orange juice and spaghetti. Spaghetti is clumpy enough that it wouldn't cling to the face and thus would have a low impact on visibility, but it would get under the feet and impede mobility, making a player easier to hit. Orange juice would drip off your face but soak into your clothes, lowering cleanliness and making it harder for the victor to run, get completely washed, and pin cleanup and responsibility for the mess on the loser. The players' current mobility, visibility and cleanliness would all factor into whether they were hit/landed a successful strike or not and how much damage was done, along with a randomized factor of 'good/bad' luck. When two of one player's properties are brought down to ten percent the game ends.
